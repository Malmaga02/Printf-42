## FT_PRINT PROJECT
#### ABOUT FT_PRINTF
In this project, I reproduce the behavior of the famous printf function in c, handling
the main conversions (cspdiuxX%). 
The principals skills I learned were the application of va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end macros
and the conversions between numbering systems.
###### ABOUT 42 FLORENCE
This is one of the first project I worked on while attending 42 Florence, an innovating programming school.
The course is mainly in C, but you get to explore C++, HTML, JavaScript and a little bit of Python, thanks 
to the workshops and events that the school provides.
